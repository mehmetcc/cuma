This is a single page Web application written with Vanilla JS and HTML5. It basically manipulates a simple <Canvas> object, so there are no fancy JS Graphics libraries involved. The code is pretty straightforward for anyone interested in, and I would really appreciate any contributors because currently there is no dynamic text feature and therefore it sucks to use it on mobile.

A current demo resides in: [cuma](http://mehmetcan.io/cuma/)

## TODOs (mostly text related)
[ ] Add support for different fonts  
[ ] Add support for multiline texts  
[ ] Add support for dynamic text sizing (currently fixed to 30pts)
